System-specific notes
---------------------
The code were run with Matlab R2016a or higher versions on Windows 10 machines.

How to use it?
---------------------
This toolbox consists of three multimodal feature learning appraoches, i.e., CoSpace-l2, CoSpace-l1, S2FL. More significantly, three multimodal remote sensing benchmark datasets, e.g., HS-MS Houston2013, HS-SAR Berlin, and HS-SAR-DSM Augsburg, are freely and openly available from the following link, contributing to the community. For more details, please refer to the paper.
